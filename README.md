# Computer Architecture

Welcome to my first homework assignment! 🙂

In this assignment, I worked on modifying an assembly program to deepen my understanding of assembly language, its core concepts, functionality, and uses. Additionally, I enhanced an interpreter to gain insights into syntax and lexical analysis.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, I aimed to:

- Learn how to modify existing assembly code to solve new computational problems.
- Strengthen my knowledge of working with processor registers.
- Understand how an assembly program interacts with hardware to execute computations.
- Gain experience modifying the lexer and parser to recognize and process new types of tokens and operations.
- Update an interpreter to handle various operations and correctly process expressions with parentheses.

ready to dive in! 💪🏼
